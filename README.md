# Secure Data Hiding in Image using Steganography

This project is a web-based application that allows users to securely encrypt text messages into images and later decrypt them using a password. It combines Python, Flask, and OpenCV for the backend, alongside HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The goal is to demonstrate how steganography (hiding data within images) can be used for secure text encryption and decryption.
